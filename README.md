# School-helper-for-children
This is a WPF application written in C# that lets children develop basic skills in English, Maths, and Science. Aimed at Keystage 1 - 2.

I wrote this before I learnt about Data-binding and the MV-VM / MVC Design patterns. Logic behind the code, the methods I used to implement them, and the general look and feel to the application is what I would like to be communicated through this application.
